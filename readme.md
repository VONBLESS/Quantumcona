# Historical Data Management for Derivatives

This project provides an efficient solution for managing large historical datasets of derivatives such as Nifty, BankNifty, FinNifty, and BankEx, including multiple option expiries. The project handles data extraction, processing, and filtering based on expiry dates using Yahoo Finance and other sources like ICICI Breeze API or data extracted from Telegram channels.

## Key Features
- **Efficient Data Loading:** Uses Dask for parallel processing of large datasets.
- **Data Partitioning:** Saves data partitioned by Year and Month using the Parquet format for efficient querying and storage.
- **Expiry-Based Filtering:** Provides a function to filter derivative data based on options expiry.
- **Support for Multiple Derivatives:** Handles data for multiple indices (Nifty, BankNifty, FinNifty) simultaneously.

## Data Source
The data is fetched using:
1. **Yahoo Finance:** For historical data of Nifty, BankNifty, and FinNifty.
2. **Alternative Sources (Optional):** 
   - **Telegram Channel:** Historical data files may be extracted from `.feather` and `.zip` formats available on the channel [here](https://2ly.link/1ztTU).
   - **ICICI Breeze API:** For accessing historical options and futures data.

## Technologies Used
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation.
- **Dask:** For handling large datasets with parallel processing.
- **Yahoo Finance API (yfinance):** To download historical data.
- **Parquet:** For efficient data storage and partitioning.
- **Feather:** For working with Feather files (optional, if data is extracted from Telegram or other sources).
  
## Data Storage and Retrieval Strategy
### Data Structure:
1. **Partitioning by Year and Month:** 
   - Data is stored in the Parquet format in subdirectories organized by Year and Month. This reduces the number of partitions and allows for efficient querying and access.
   - Example structure:
     ```
     data/
        ^NSEI/
            Year=2020/
                Month=1/
                    part-0000.parquet
                Month=2/
                    part-0000.parquet
            Year=2021/
                Month=1/
                    part-0000.parquet
     ```

2. **Multiple Derivatives Support:** 
   - Data for multiple tickers (`^NSEI`, `^NSEBANK`, `NIFTY_FIN_SERVICE.NS`) is handled separately, ensuring modular and clean data handling.

### Expiry-Based Filtering:
- Data is filtered dynamically based on expiry dates for options contracts. Once the data is loaded, expiry-based strategies can be applied using the `filter_by_expiry` function, assuming the dataset includes expiry information.

### Storage Format:
- **Parquet:** Highly efficient for large datasets, supports partitioning, and is compatible with Dask for distributed data processing.
- **Feather:** Optional, if historical data is sourced from `.feather` files (from Telegram).

## Code Overview
### 1. Fetch Historical Data
```python
def fetch_data(ticker):
    data = yf.download(ticker, start=start_date, end=end_date, progress=False)
    return data
```
Fetches historical data from Yahoo Finance for a given ticker.

### 2. Save Data to Partitioned Parquet
```python
def save_to_parquet(df, file_name):
    df.to_parquet(f"{DATA_DIR}{file_name}", partition_cols=['Year', 'Month'])
```
Saves the data into partitioned Parquet files, organized by Year and Month.

### 3. Load Data Efficiently with Dask
```python
def load_data(file_name):
    df = dd.read_parquet(f"{DATA_DIR}{file_name}")
    return df
```
Loads large datasets using Dask for parallel processing.

### 4. Filter Data by Expiry (Options)
```python
def filter_by_expiry(data, expiry_date):
    filtered_data = data[data['expiry'] == expiry_date]
    return filtered_data
```
Filters the loaded data based on the expiry date for options contracts.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/VONBLESS/historical-data-management.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
### 1. Download and Save Historical Data
Run the script to download and save historical data:
```bash
python task1.py
```

### 2. Load and Filter Data by Expiry
```python
nifty_df = load_data('NSEI')
filtered_options = filter_by_expiry(nifty_df, '2023-12-28')
```
